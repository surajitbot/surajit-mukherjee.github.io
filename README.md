## About Me  
I am an MSc in Computer Science with a strong background in computer vision (internships under Prof. P. Shivakumara & Prof. Umapada Pal). My current research interest lies in **multimodal text recognition systems**, specifically leveraging scene background information to enhance text understanding (e.g., text + background correlation). I am actively seeking a PhD position for Fall/Winter 2025-26 to explore challenges in **text-to-scene generation**, **multimodal video prediction**, and **document / scene image analysis**.

## Projects  
- **CLIP4STR-inspired model** – Developed a classification pipeline where text and background features are fused for improved recognition (see code/demo).  
- **SpO₂ Detection Website** – Django-based application integrating heartbeat detection and rPPG signal processing from video.  
- **Text-to-Scene Generation** – Ongoing work: generating realistic scene images from extracted text cues, computing FID scores for evaluation.  
- (Add links to each project repository/dashboard.)

## Looking for  
I am seeking a **fully funded PhD position** (Fall/Winter 2025-26 intake) in / with:  
- Supervisor(s) working on multimodal vision, text + image, generative AI  
- Strong computer vision lab, interest in indigenous language AI (e.g., Bengali) a plus  
- Opportunity to publish in top venues (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICDAR)  
- Collaboration with both academia & industry encouraged  

If you’re recruiting or know of opportunities, I’d love to connect!
